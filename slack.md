# The `fcc-norman` Slack Channel

Join us on [slack](https://slack.com/downloads)! Our friends at [Techlahoma](https://www.techlahoma.org/) have hooked us up with a free slack channel so we can hang out and chat on our laptops, tablets, phones, and browsers from anywhere.

With [slack](https://slack.com/downloads) we can send messages to the chat, send direct messages to one another, share our screens, or even video chat.

## Sign up for Slack chat with your email address

First, you must get an invite by going [here](http://slack.techlahoma.org/) and clicking `GET MY INVITE`

Then log into your email account and check for the message: `Techlahoma Foundation has invited you to join a Slack workspace` and then click `Join Now`

Fill out your `Full Name`, `Display Name`, and `Password` and then click `Next`.

After your review the terms of service click `I Agree` to be greeted by a friendly tutorial.

Slack is a powerful app and there is a lot to learn!  To quickly join the chat with us type `/join #fcc-norman`

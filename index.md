# Free Code Camp Norman Study Group

We're at the [Tom Love Innovation Hub](https://www.ou.edu/innovationhub) in Norman Oklahoma.

Come learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web development with us! From beginners looking to get started to more experienced coders looking to help others while improving their own skills, everyone is welcome!

Join us and introduce yourself and meet others who are also learning to code. Create a free account on [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and bring your laptop if you have one! If you don't have one, message one of the organizers on [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/freecodecamp-norman/) and we will try and prepare one for you.

Don't worry if you can't make it at 6:30 on the dot, or if you can't stay the whole two hours. Feel free to join us when you can and for as long as you want!

## Calendar

You can find our up to date calendar and RSVP at [meetup.com/freecodecamp-norman](https://www.meetup.com/freecodecamp-norman/). It's 100% Free!
